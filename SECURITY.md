# ðŸ”’ Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support and maintain the `main` branch of rKitPvP. At time of writing there are no releases available.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g. duplication bug, command injection, data leak), please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

ðŸ“§ `tijn@vurtuality.com`  
_Or_  
ðŸ“¬ Open a GitHub security advisory (if available on this repo)

We aim to respond within **48 hours**.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- Plugin-level exploits (e.g. unsafe commands, coin farming, config bypasses)
- Code-level vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection, unsafe reflection)

Out-of-scope issues:

- Bugs unrelated to security
- Poor performance
- Conflicts with third-party plugins
